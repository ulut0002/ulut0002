## About Me

With a strong interest in web and mobile application development, I am keen to contribute to innovative projects and collaborate with dynamic teams.

I recently graduated from Algonquin College's Mobile Application Design and Development program, where I acquired both technical and design skills. My education focused on user-centered design and a variety of technologies.

Currently, I am transitioning into mobile app and full-stack developer roles as a junior developer, leveraging my solid background in ERP and B2C/B2B experiences. During my professional journey, I have collaborated with various departments on diverse projects, enhancing my ability to adapt and contribute to different aspects of development.

As a professional, I am accountable, committed to my tasks, and driven to achieve optimal results. I value teamwork and strive to support my colleagues, ensuring a collaborative and productive work environment. My objective is to join a team where technology is leveraged to accomplish goals and significantly contribute to the company's success.

I am particularly drawn to opportunities that involve developing and maintaining efficient and scalable web / mobile applications. I thrive in environments where cross-functional teams collaborate to define, design, and deliver new features, troubleshoot software defects, and optimize application performance for maximum speed and scalability.
